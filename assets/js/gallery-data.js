The map depicts the maritime routes from Manila to Spain and to New Spain (Mexico and other Spanish territory in the New World), which at the time was a crucial element of the Spanish Empire."

The chapter begins with Rizal's description of the town. The town is surrounded by farmland which is also close to lakes and rivers. That's why many people are amazed at this town because of the beautiful scenery here. While San Diego does not really exist, Rizal modeled the town after his province, Laguna. Laguna has been historically active in the past."

On his journey to his exile in Dapitan, the good doctor Rizal stopped in Dumaguete. During his brief visit, he apparently enjoyed the town and its European vibe, particularly after enjoying breakfast one morning and listening to classical piano music drifting across the plaza."
