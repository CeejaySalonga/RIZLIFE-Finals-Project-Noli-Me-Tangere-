            description: "Sophisticated, highly admired, and idealistic, Ibarra is a wealthy young mestizo who recently returned to the Philippines after studying in Europe for seven years. Given his extremely liberal education and connections, the priests of San Diego all regard him with some caution. Equally idealistic, his father, Don Rafael, was imprisoned and eventually killed after being called a heretic and subversive by the corrupt priesthood. Ibarra wants to follow in his father's footsteps by starting a school in San Diego, but he becomes caught up in disputes with the church and is compelled to leave the city due to a plot headed by the cunning Father Salví. In contrast to his more radical friend Elías, Ibarra generally wants to work within systems to reform the Philippines, rather than overthrow them, but he shifts towards Elías's beliefs as the novel progresses."

            description: "She is a well-known woman who is said to be Father Dámaso's goddaughter and Capitan Tiago's daughter. She is actually Father Dámaso's biological daughter, born out of a scandalous marriage between Capitan Tiago's wife and the elderly priest. María Clara, who grew up with Ibarra, intended to wed him, but Father Dámaso was against the idea. Ibarra's guardians arrange for her to marry Linares, a wealthy young man of Spanish ancestry, after she is excommunicated from the church. She attempts to comply with the arrangement in order to protect her father, the docile Capitan Tiago. She is forced to turn up the letters Ibarra sent her as proof of his guilt when he is tried for sedition. In the end, she declines to wed Linares and enters a convent after learning of Ibarra's purported passing."

            description: "Father Dámaso is an elderly, greedy, and blatantly dishonest Spanish priest who has spent almost twenty years living among the indigenous Filipinos. Despite spending so much time with them, the years have not made him like or sympathetic to his 'flock.' He is deeply racist, petty, and vindictive, and he has no problem using his considerable influence to destroy the lives of those who have wronged him, no matter how minor the transgression. After masterminding Don Rafael Ibarra's killing, he shamelessly made fun of the younger Ibarra. Ibarra confronts his father after he publicly disparages him, and he excommunicates Ibarra from the church. He is also the godfather (and, in fact, the biological father) of María Clara, giving him influence over her relationship with Ibarra."

The more temperate Ibarra and he meet when Ibarra heroically defends him from a crocodile. Elías collaborates closely with Ibarra during the second half of the book after discovering a conspiracy against his life. In their lengthy discussions about the morality of politics and government, Elias adopts a more revolutionary attitude than Ibarra."

Because he is a more skilled strategist who utilizes his religious vocation for both personal grudges and political power, he is in many ways more dangerous than his predecessor. Power struggles between him and the town's ensign are common. In the book, his plot to derail Ibarra—who is engaged to María Clara, whom he loves—is his most important contribution."

He maintains tight relationships with prominent Catholics, even though he has no regard for religion, and he openly participates in racist taunts directed at his peers. Getting his daughter, María Clara, married off to a wealthy guy from a powerful family is his top priority. This is a major factor in his hasty decision to abandon his allegiance to Ibarra when he is called a subversive. He is eager to agree that Linares could be his daughter's new partner because he tends to favor beneficial social connections."
