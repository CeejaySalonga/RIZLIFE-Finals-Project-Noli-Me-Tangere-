                    <p class="txt-justify txt-white">
                        Themes of social injustice, political corruption, and the struggle for freedom into modern Noli Me Tangere have not been dated. This most recent novel is truly relevant, as it portrays the continuous imperative of society. It shows systemic oppression and severe inequalities, in such a manner that mirrored modern struggles wherein people in the margins are blocked from having justice and social mobility. Besides, for Rizal's expose of systemic corruption within political and religious institutions, such resonates even within the modern societies still dealing with issues of governance and the transparency. The parallel, again, can be noticed in the characters' struggles for autonomy under foreign occupation and the contemporary movements that advocate for the preservation of culture, human rights, and national independence.

                    <p class="txt-justify">
                        Education is seen as the vehicle for enlightenment for Rizal; an informed populace can raise opposition to oppression and colonial mentality, a belief manifest in his reform proposals and intellectual contributions. Rizal advocated the need for reform in society and decried the Spanish colonial corruptions and sought peaceful means like representation in the Spanish Cortes, secularization of friars, education improvement, among other cures. This novel also becomes in opposition to the freedom and nationalism itself in encouraging the Filipino to identify and free himself from oppression - messages that later should spark the Philippine Revolution. These themes are relevant today when societies continue to struggle toward justice, reforms in governance, or national identity due to globalization.

                    <p class="txt-justify txt-white">
                        The novel, has innumerable legacies of corruption, inequality, and searches for national identity, which emerge as dwindling echoes in modern society. Rizal's exposition of social injustices challenges readers to reflect upon ensconced systems and ultimately develop enlightenment of historic patterns that continue to engage the present. Therefore, through attributing education as a significant power, the novel seeks  individuals  who may use knowledge as a resolution to humanistic reforms. Rizal's clarion call further inspires civic engagement, allowing people to take the path of activism, gentle governance, and grassroots endeavors toward social justice. In a rapidly globalizing world, Noli Me Tangere would serve as a reminder for informed, active citizenship with respect to modern issues in pursuit of a just and equitable condition in society.
