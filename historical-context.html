                    During the height of Spanish colonial power in the Philippines, when Noli Me Tangere was penned, socioeconomic inequality, forced labor, and tyranny were commonplace. Filipinos were exploited and resistance was repressed by the powerful Spanish government and friars. Rizal's experiences in the Philippines and Europe, where he was exposed to progressive ideas and Enlightenment principles, had a significant impact on the book. In order to draw attention to the need for reform, Rizal attempted to shed light on the wrongdoings of colonial officials and the clergy. Because of its contentious nature, Rizal had trouble getting backing for the book's release, and it was finally published in Berlin, Germany, in 1887. The book was essential in reawakening Filipinos' sense of national identity. Noli Me Tangere sparked conversations about justice, government, and national identity by depicting the social realities of colonial authority. Its release strengthened Filipino opposition to Spain and prepared the ground for the ultimate uprising that resulted in Philippine independence.
